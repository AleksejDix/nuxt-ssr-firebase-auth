This is an example of using Nuxt.js in SSR mode with Firebase Authentication

[Live Demo](https://nuxt-firebase-auth.now.sh)

This example uses Heroku and you can find deploy instructions on the Nuxt.js documentation site:

## Notes
For the Sign-In to work, you will need to add the site url to the Firebase's Authorized Domains in the Authorization settings of the Firebase Console.
